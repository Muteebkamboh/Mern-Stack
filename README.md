# Mern Stack 
This repository is all about my Mern stack journey.

# Introduction

The MERN stack is a popular collection of technologies used for building dynamic, full-stack web applications. It combines four key technologies:

# 1.MongoDB:
A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Itâ€™s known for its scalability and performance, making it an ideal choice for applications that handle large amounts of data.

# 2.Express.js: 
A minimal, flexible web application framework built on top of Node.js. It simplifies the creation of robust back-end APIs and is used to handle routing and server-side logic in a MERN application.

# 3.React.js: 
A JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create dynamic, component-based UIs with efficient rendering using a virtual DOM. React is ideal for creating single-page applications with smooth user experiences.

# 4.Node.js: 
A runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and is known for its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, making it highly efficient and scalable for building server-side applications.
